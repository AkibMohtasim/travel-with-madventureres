# A Travel Agency based demo website

This project was created with React, and the styling was done by Tailwind and Daisy UI [Live Website](travel-with-madventurers.web.app).


## This is a full-stack website

Here the user can browse through the services (Adventures) that the Agency provides and the user can place and cancel any order if he/she wants.


An admin can change the status of the order from 'Pending' to 'Active'. He/she can also add a new Adventure in the offerings. For these to work, he/she has to type a certain text the propmt shows.

Only one admin can cancel any order. That's why the delete button is disabled and the email of that admin is kept secret.

In the Home page there are some extra sections besides the offering, such as "About" and "Image Gallery".
